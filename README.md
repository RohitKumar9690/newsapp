This News App is powered by the GNews public API and provides users with the latest news articles from around the world. The app offers a user-friendly interface where news articles are organized by categories, allowing users to easily browse and read articles of their interest. 

## Features

- **Category-based News**: The app categorizes news articles into various categories, including entertainment, business, sports, technology, health, science, and more. Users can click on a category to view articles specific to that category.

- **Themes mode**: The app includes theme mode that enables users to switch in light and dark mode.

- **Article Details**: Each article is displayed with a title, description, publication date, channel, and a link to visit the source website. This ensures that users can get a comprehensive understanding of the news article before deciding to read more.

- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience across different screen sizes and devices. Whether users access the app from their desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the interface will adapt smoothly to fit their device.

## Technologies Used
